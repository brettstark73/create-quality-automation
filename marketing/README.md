# Marketing Materials

This folder contains marketing reference materials for QA Architect.

## Purpose

These files are **NOT deployed as part of the CLI** - they serve as:

- Reference documentation for marketing copy
- Templates for external website updates
- Historical record of feature messaging

## Folders

### `reference/`

Reference copies of marketing pages (e.g., landing page HTML).

**Important**: These are snapshots only. The live website is managed in the `vibebuildlab` project. Updates here must be manually synced to that project.

## Updating Marketing Materials

When adding new features:

1. Update `README.md` with feature details
2. Update `reference/landing-page.html` to document the messaging
3. Create issue in `vibebuildlab` project to sync changes to live site
4. Update `BACKLOG.md` with MK\* tasks tracking website updates

## Live Deployments

- **Website**: vibebuildlab.com/qa-architect (managed in separate repo)
- **CLI**: Published to npm from this repo
- **Documentation**: GitHub README.md
